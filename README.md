Thanks for sharing the screenshot, Kusuma! You're almost done — but I noticed your `README.md` could be improved for **readability and structure**.

### 🔧 Issues in Current README

* Text is not broken into sections (all content runs together).
* No headings for **Features**, **Technologies Used**, etc.
* It looks less professional without proper formatting.

### ✅ Suggested Fix (Updated `README.md`)

Replace your current `README.md` content with this:

# 🖱️ Mouse Cursor Control Using Color Object Detection

This project allows users to control the mouse cursor using a colored object (like a red or blue marker) tracked through a webcam. It uses computer vision techniques to detect the object and map its movement to control the mouse in real-time.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Detects a specific color object using OpenCV
- Tracks object position in real-time
- Controls mouse cursor based on object movement
- Simple and user-friendly interface

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- PyAutoGUI (for mouse control)
- NumPy

---

## 📘 How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mouse-cursor.git
````

2. Navigate into the folder

   ```bash
   cd mouse-cursor
   ```

3. Install required libraries

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the script

   ```bash
   python mousecursor.py
   ```
